title: Forcing Myself to Learn
---

Jekyll looks to be much more...needy than Wordpress and hopefully that'll mean I learn more.  There is of course the danger that it'll keep me from blogging (danger...right...) but I think I'm willing to risk that.

And because I'm extra crazy I'm not doing it the easy way.  I'm using Henrik Nyh's fork so I can use HAML and I'm using Compass because I used it before and it just makes CSS so much less painful.
