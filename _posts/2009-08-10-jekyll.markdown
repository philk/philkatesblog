Forcing Myself to Learn
-----------------------

Jekyll looks to be much more...needy than Wordpress and hopefully that'll mean I learn more.  There is of course the danger that it'll keep me from blogging (danger...right...) but I think I'm willing to risk that.

And because I'm extra crazy I'm not doing it the easy way.  I'm using Henrik Nyh's fork so I can use HAML and I'm using Compass because I used it before and it just makes CSS so much less painful.

ls /usr/local
ls /usr/place

{% highlight ruby %}
require "feedzirra"
def rssfeed(feed_url)
  feed = Feedzirra::Feed.fetch_and_parse(feed_url).entries
end
{% endhighlight %}
